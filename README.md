#Conductor

***

##Introduction

Conductor is a useful way to keep track of, update, and watch the progress, asynchronous `NSOperation` jobs in an `NSOperationQueue`.

Often times in iOS apps there is a need to manage asynchronous background tasks.  Frequently, these tasks can be grouped into specific types of operations, like downloading images from a web service, or parsing a JSON response from an API.  Moving as much processing as you can off the main thread is vital for a good user experience so we don't lock up the user interface, for instance.

The iOS SDK offers several ways to execute background tasks.  CGD is fantastic for one off asynchronous operations.  The `NSOperationQueue` class is a great way to collect `NSOperation` objects, but it isn't immediately obvious how to observer the state of your queue.  Conductor was written to pick up the slack where these API's fall short. With Conductor, you can:

* Keep track of multiple `NSOperationQueue` objects.  Use one for image downloading and one for JSON operations.  Easily suspend all image downloads, or cancel them outright when the user switches screens.
* Easily observer the progress of a given queue.  Add a `UIProgressView` and show the user your image download progress and execute a completion block when the queue is finished.
* Change the `NSOperationQueuePriority` for a specific operation in a queue.  For example, change the priority of thumbnail image downloads as the user scrolls a `UITableView`.

##Installation

Conductor is built as a modern static library, based on some of the excellent conventions detailed by Jonah Williams on [Using Open Source Static Libraries in Xcode 4](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/04/04/using-open-source-static-libraries-in-xcode-4/).  I highly recommend reading this to understand how the installation process works.

1. Add Conductor as a git submodule to your repository. `git submodule add git@github.com:ChazInc/Conductor.git`
2. Add `Conductor.xcodeproj` to your project. `File > Add Files to "MyProject"â€¦`
3. Add Conductor as a target dependency to your app target under the `Build Phases` menu.
4. Link the binary to the Conductor library.
5. Add `$(OBJROOT)/UninstalledProducts/include` to your **User Header Search Paths**, and set **Always Search User Paths** to Yes.
6. Import Conductor with `#import <Conductor/Conductor.h>`
7. Build the project to check and make sure you setup everything correctly.

##Adding Operations

To use Conductor, first you have to subclass `CDOperation`, which is itself an `NSOperation` subclass.  Lets build a really simple operation to play around with, which is the same as the `CDTestOperation` in ConductorTests.

```objective-c
#import "Conductor/CDOperation.h"

@interface TestOperation : CDOperation

@end

@implementation TestOperation

- (void)start {
    @autoreleasepool {
        [super start];
    
        sleep(1.0);
    
        [self finish];
    }
}

@end
```

As you can see, this operation just waits for one second before finishing.  Now lets add a bunch of operations to our Conductor singleton.  To slow things down, let's set the max concurrency operation count to 1 for our queue.  This will result in serial operation of our `TestOperation` so we can see what is happening in the log.

```objective-c
Conductor *conductor = [Conductor sharedInstance];
NSString *myQueueName = @"MyQueueName";

[conductor addProgressObserverToQueueNamed:myQueueName 
                         withProgressBlock:^(float progress) {
                             NSLog(@"progress: %f", progress);
                         }
                        andCompletionBlock:^ {
                            NSLog(@"Finished!");
                        }];

[conductor setMaxConcurrentOperationCount:1 
                            forQueueNamed:myQueueName];
    
for (NSInteger i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    TestOperation *operation = [TestOperation operation];
    [conductor addOperation:operation toQueueNamed:myQueueName]; 
}
```

##Subclassing CDOperation

Safe methods available to override in CDOperation subclasses included `start` and `finish.` Conductor uses KVO to keep track of when operations finish by observing the `isFinished` property on CDOperation.  It's probably a good idea to read Apple's guide on [subclassing NSOperation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSOperation_class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004591-RH2-SW18) to understand how the design works.  Subclasses have to properly [respond to the cancel command](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSOperation_class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004591-RH2-SW18).  The `start` method of CDOperation does some of that work for you.

```objective-c
- (void)start {
    ConductorLogTrace(@"Started operation: %@", self.identifier);
    
    if (self.isCancelled) {
        [self finish];
        return;
    }

    // Don't forget to wrap your operation in an autorelease pool
    
    self.state = CDOperationStateExecuting;
}
```

Remember to call `[super start]` in your subclass.  If you have a particularly long running operation, it is up to you to decide when you might need to respond to a cancel command.  Sometimes it's best to let operations finish, sometimes it's best to respond mid execution;  your design depends on your needs.

Besides the implementing the`start` method, you also need to call `[self finish]` when your operation is done to trigger KVO.  You don't have to implement it, but it might be useful for some custom cleanup.

##Updating Priority

Conductor allows you to keep track of specific operations by using the operations identifier.  You can either assign your own identifier to an operations, or get a unique string on query.  Store these identifiers to update priority.

```objective-c
Conductor *conductor = [Conductor sharedInstance];
NSString *myQueueName = @"MyQueueName";

TestOperation *operation = [TestOperation operation];
[conductor addOperation:operation];

[conductor updatePriorityOfOperationWithIdentifier:operation.identifier 
                                             					 toNewPriority:NSOperationQueuePriorityVeryHigh];
```
